I am currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, supervised by Prof. [Ning Liu](http://cse.sysu.edu.cn/node/2495) in [Intelligent and Multimedia Science Laboratory](https://www.sysu-imsl.com). I received the B.S. and M.S. degree in computer science and technology from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2017 and 2020, respectively. 

My research interests mainly lie in **indoor navigation and positioning algorithms** and **location-based data analysis**, to channel theory and algorithms into empowering the location-based applications.
