I am currently a Ph.D. student in [School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://sdcs.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Ning Liu](http://sdcs.sysu.edu.cn/node/2495) in [Intelligent and Multimedia Science Laboratory](https://www.sysu-imsl.com/). 

Research
======
My research interests mainly lie in efficient large scale machine learning with theoretical guarantee, but also include kernel methods, semi-supervised learning (SSL) and interpretability of neural networks.
Indeed, my works focus on generalization analysis of those areas and building effective and scalable optimization tools for them, to channel theory and algorithms into applications.
